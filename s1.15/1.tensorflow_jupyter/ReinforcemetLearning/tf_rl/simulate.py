    Parameters
    -------
    simulation: tr_lr.simulation
        simulation that will be simulated ;-)
    controller: tr_lr.controller
        controller used
    fps: int
        frames per seconds
    visualize_every: int
        visualize every `visualize_every`-th frame.
    action_every: int
        take action every `action_every`-th frame
    simulation_resolution: float
        simulate at most 'simulation_resolution' seconds at a time.
        If None, the it is set to 1/FPS (default).
    wait: boolean
        whether to intentionally slow down the simulation
        to appear real time.
    disable_training: bool
        if true training_step is never called.
    save_path: str
        save svg visualization (only tl_rl.utils.svg
        supported for the moment)
